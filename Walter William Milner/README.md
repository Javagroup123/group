# Honouring teh Legacy of Walter W. Milner

Walter created the [Java group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Javagroup123/) around 2007 and helped so many of us learning how to program. Sadly, he passed away in 2022. He is greatly missed. 

There is a website created by family and friends:

**[Tribute to Dr Walter William Milner, 1952 - 2022](https://waltermilner.muchloved.com/)**

However, his personal website is no longer available. 
You can still find some old copies on the [way back machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220101000000*/https://www.waltermilner.com/).
The website was mostly a collection of his teaching material, all as pdf documents. You can all of them right here in this repository.
A copy of all files in that archive is available in [web.zip](./web.zip) (downloaded using wget, so the links don't really work).
